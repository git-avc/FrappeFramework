# Frappe Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

The below prerequisites are advised in order to get an optimal functionality of ERPNext on your server.
### Software Requirements

    Updated Ubuntu 22.04
    A user with sudo privileges
    Python 3.10+
    Node.js 16

### Hardware Requirements

    4GB RAM
    40GB Hard Disk

## Server Settings
### Update and Upgrade Packages

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

### Create a new user â€“ (bench user)

In linux, the root user processes escalated privileges to perform any tasks within the system. This is why it is not advisable to use this user on a daily basis. We will create a user that we can use, and this will be the user we will also use as the Frappe Bench User.
```
sudo adduser [frappe-user]
usermod -aG sudo [frappe-user]
su [frappe-user] 
cd /home/[frappe-user]
```
Ensure you have replaced [frappe-user] with your username. eg. sudo adduser frappe

## Install Required Packages


A software like ERPNext, which is built on Frappe Framework, requires a number of packages in order to run smoothly. These are the packages we will be installing in this step.

### Install GIT
```
sudo apt-get install git
```
### Install Python

ERPNext version 14 requires Python version 3.10+. This is what we will install in this step.
```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3.10-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-distutils
```
### Install Python Virtual Environment

A virtual environment helps in managing the dependencies for one software at one place, without having to interfere with other sections in the computer or server in which the software is running.
```
sudo apt-get install python3.10-venv
```

### Install Software Properties Common

Software Properties Common will help in repository management.
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
```
### Install MariaDB

ERPNext is built to naively run on MariaDB. The team is working to have the same working on PostgreSQL, but this is not ready yet.
```
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client
```
### Install Redis Server
```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```
### Install other packages

ERPNext functionality also relies on other packages we will install in this step. These will load fonts, PDFs, and other resources to our instance.
```
sudo apt-get install xvfb libfontconfig wkhtmltopdf
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
```
### Configure MYSQL Server
#### Setup the server
```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
When you run this command, the server will show the following prompts. Please follow the steps as shown below to complete the setup correctly.

    Enter current password for root: (Enter your SSH root user password)
    Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]: Y
    Change the root password? [Y/n]: Y
    It will ask you to set new MySQL root password at this step. This can be different from the SSH root user password.
    Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
    Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: N
    This is set as N because we might want to access the database from a remote server for using business analytics software like Metabase / PowerBI / Tableau, etc.
    Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]: Y
    Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]: Y

#### Edit MYSQL default config file
```
sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```
Add the following block of code exactly as is:
```
[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8mb4
```
#### Restart the MYSQL Server
```
sudo service mysql restart
```
### Install CURL
```
sudo apt install curl
```
### Install Node
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash

source ~/.profile

nvm install 16.15.0
```
### Install NPM
```
sudo apt-get install npm
```
### Install Yarn
```
sudo npm install -g yarn
```
### Install Frappe Bench
```
sudo pip3 install frappe-bench
```
### Initialize Frappe Bench
```
bench init --frappe-branch version-14 frappe-bench
```
### Switch Directories into the Frappe Bench directory
```
cd frappe-bench
```
### Change User Directory Permissions

This will give the bench user execution permission to the home directory.
```
chmod -R o+rx /home/[frappe-user]
```
### Create a New Site

A site is a requirement in ERPNext, Frappe and all the other apps we will be needing to install. We will create the site in this step.
```
bench new-site [site-name]
```
### Create a New App 

```
bench new-app [app-name]
```
### Install App on Site
```
bench --site [site-name] install-app [app-name]
```
### Strart Frappe Server
You can start the server by running the below command:
```
bench start
```
